-> Software Design Assignment – Merge Sort Project

This is my project for MSO2700.  
It includes a Java code that organise a list of words using the "Merge Sort" algorithm.

I’ve also written a simple test class to check that the sorting works correctly.
* Some of the codes were, originally, made by steps. As I do not feel comfortable with
coding - not my strong suit - I have to be methodic and structured. I need to follow
a path in order for me not to get loss. 
The "step by step" may not be the most appropiate way of explaining the code, It has been exchange for a more function approach rather than a systematic approach.

-> What is in the project 

Files:                                                       

`MyClass.java`: The main class that runs the test and prints results 
`Sorter.java`: Contains the code for merge sorting a list         
`SortedTester.java`: A test method to make sure the sorting works        
`List.java`: Primary code. Linked to local prompt and GitHub.

-> How It Works

- The program sorts a list of words (like "April", "January", etc.) using merge sort.
- It splits the list, sorts each half, and merges them back together.
- The test checks if the output matches the expected sorted version.
